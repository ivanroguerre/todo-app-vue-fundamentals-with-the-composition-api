# TODO App

This is my first Vue project. The idea spawned after watching the Vue.js 3 **Fundamentals with the Composition API** course from vue school. The visual inspiration came from [this figma file](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1348652218299666548/todo-app).

Here is a screenshot of the target app that I'm recreating here:
